## Hey everyone, I'm Lorenzo üëã 

I have been a Senior Software Engineer @ Microsoft, and a maintainer of React Native from 2018 'til 2024. I haven‚Äôt shared yet what I‚Äôm doing next üòâ

I care a lot about mental health and open source, and won‚Äôt stop talking about either.

## Worked on ‚öôÔ∏è

Here are some of the things I‚Äôve worked on over the years:

* [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), which enable you to create awesome cross-platform iOS and Android apps powered by Javascript.
* [React Native Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows), what if I told you that we can use React Native for Windows as well?
* [React Native macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos), and for macOS too!
* [rnx-kit](https://github.com/microsoft/rnx-kit), some of extra and advanced tools made at Microsoft to make RN even better!
* [React Native Test App](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-test-app), an iOS-Android-macOS-Windows React Native project without upgrading pains.
* [rn-full-pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kelset.rn-full-pack#overview), an opinionated set of extensions to be up-and-running with React Native in VSCode.

## Projects ‚ú®

Aside from code, there a few other things I have done:

* [debug:mind](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbw5AHyRBNUFzTHCVuO5q9w?sub_confirmation=1), my YouTube series where I talk with tech people about mental health.
* [Talks and Podcasts and more](https://kelset.dev/tags/), in this page you can find all my talks at confs, along with blogposts and podcasts and etc.
* [Mental Health Resources](https://github.com/kelset/mental-health-resources), a GitHub page where I collect resources around mental health and tech.
* [Job Hunting Resources](https://github.com/kelset/job-hunting-resources), a GitHub page with resources to help people in tech finding jobs.
