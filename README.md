## Hey everyone, I'm Lorenzo 👋 

I'm a Senior Software Engineer @ Microsoft, and I've been a maintainer of React Native since 2018.

I care a lot about mental health and open source, and won’t stop talking about either.

## Working on ⚙️

Here are some of the things I'm working on at... work 😅:

* [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), which enable you to create awesome cross-platform iOS and Android apps powered by Javascript.
* [React Native Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows), what if I told you that we can use React Native for Windows as well?
* [React Native macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos), and for macOS too!
* [rnx-kit](https://github.com/microsoft/rnx-kit), some of extra and advanced tools we made at Microsoft to make RN even better!
* [React Native Test App](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-test-app), an iOS-Android-macOS-Windows React Native project without upgrading pains.

And if you want to learn more about how we use React Native at Microsoft, you should check out [Microsoft's React Native official DevBlog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/react-native/).

## Projects ✨

Aside from code, there a few other things I have done:

* [debug:mind](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbw5AHyRBNUFzTHCVuO5q9w?sub_confirmation=1), my YouTube series where I talk with tech people about mental health.
* [Talks and Podcasts and more](https://kelset.dev/tags/), in this page you can find all my talks at confs, along with blogposts and podcasts and etc.
* [Mental Health Resources](https://github.com/kelset/mental-health-resources), a GitHub page where I collect resources around mental health and tech.
* [React Native Community Map](https://github.com/kelset/react-native-community-map), a GitHub page for mapping where the RN community is.
* [Job Hunting Resources](https://github.com/kelset/job-hunting-resources), a GitHub page with resources to help people in tech finding jobs.
* [rn-full-pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kelset.rn-full-pack#overview), an opinionated set of extensions to be up-and-running with React Native in VSCode.
