## Hey everyone, I'm Lorenzo üëã 

I am currently working as a Technologist for the [Sovereign Tech Fund](https://www.sovereigntechfund.de), making open source more sustainable. Previously, I have been a Senior Software Engineer at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/) and a dedicated maintainer of [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) for 6+ years. I'm also an vocal advocate for mental health.

## Worked on ‚öôÔ∏è

Here are some of the things I've worked on as a software engineer and maintainer over the years:

* [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), which enable you to create awesome cross-platform iOS and Android apps powered by Javascript.
* [React Native Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows), what if I told you that we can use React Native for Windows as well?
* [React Native macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos), and for macOS too!
* [rnx-kit](https://github.com/microsoft/rnx-kit), some of extra and advanced tools made at Microsoft to make RN even better!
* [React Native Test App](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-test-app), an iOS-Android-macOS-Windows React Native project without upgrading pains.
* [rn-full-pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kelset.rn-full-pack#overview), an opinionated set of extensions to be up-and-running with React Native in VSCode.

## Projects ‚ú®

Aside from code, there a few other things I have done:

* [debug:mind](https://debug-mind.com/), my YouTube series where I talk with tech people about mental health; on its website you can also find resources I collect around mental health and tech.
* [Talks and Podcasts and more](https://kelset.dev/tags/), in this page you can find all my talks at confs, along with blogposts and podcasts and etc.
* [Job Hunting Resources](https://github.com/kelset/job-hunting-resources), a GitHub page with resources to help people in tech finding jobs.
