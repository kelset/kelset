## üëã Hey everyone, I'm Lorenzo

I'm a Senior Software Engineer @ Microsoft, and I've been a maintainer of React Native since 2018.

I care a lot about mental health and open source, and won‚Äôt stop talking about either.

## Working on ‚öôÔ∏è

Here are some of the things I'm working on at... work üòÖ:

* [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), which enable you to create awesome cross-platform iOS and Android apps powered by Javascript.
* [React Native Windows](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), what if I told you that we can use React Native for Windows as well?
* [React Native macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos), and for macOS too!
* [Microsoft's React Native official DevBlog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/react-native/), if the previous two projects made you curios to learn how we use React Native at Microsoft, this is where you should go!
* [rnx-kit](https://github.com/microsoft/rnx-kit), did I already say that we use React Native at Microsoft? Well, here are some extra tools we made to make the devloop even better!
* [React Native Test App](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-test-app), what if there was a way to maintain an iOS-Android-macOS-Windows React Native project without upgrading pains?

## Projects üêß

Aside from code, there a few other things I dabble with:

* [Managing Mental Health](https://www.notion.so/lifeiswhat/Managing-Mental-Health-adb0fb63a8144951b304bfb3bb7ed482) a Notion board where I collect resources around mental health and tech.
* [The React Native Community Map](https://www.notion.so/lifeiswhat/The-React-Native-Community-Map-07f3221c294d4c8ab65a13cf1dee6901) a Notion board which I use as a map of all the different places where React Native developers can be found.
* [Talks and Podcasts](https://kelset.dev/talks/) I do talks at confs, meetups and in general where devs can be found.
* [Untitled Mental Health project](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiD6R_aXkpLiMfS2YrhSgtSj09JJCaP2y) I have a YouTube series where I talk with fellow developers and tech people about mental health.
