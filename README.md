## Hey everyone, I'm Lorenzo üëã 

I'm a Senior Software Engineer @ Microsoft, and I've been a maintainer of React Native since 2018.

I care a lot about mental health and open source, and won‚Äôt stop talking about either.

## Working on ‚öôÔ∏è

Here are some of the things I'm working on at... work üòÖ:

* [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), which enable you to create awesome cross-platform iOS and Android apps powered by Javascript.
* [React Native Windows](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), what if I told you that we can use React Native for Windows as well?
* [React Native macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos), and for macOS too!
* [rnx-kit](https://github.com/microsoft/rnx-kit), some of extra and advanced tools we made at Microsoft to make RN even better!
* [React Native Test App](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-test-app), an iOS-Android-macOS-Windows React Native project without upgrading pains.

And if you want to learn more about how we use React Native at Microsoft, you should check out [Microsoft's React Native official DevBlog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/react-native/).

## Projects ‚ú®

Aside from code, there a few other things I dabble with:

* [Talks and Podcasts](https://kelset.dev/talks/), I do talks at confs, meetups and in general where devs can be found.
* [Untitled Mental Health project](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiD6R_aXkpLiMfS2YrhSgtSj09JJCaP2y), my YouTube series where I talk with tech people about mental health.
* [Managing Mental Health](https://www.notion.so/lifeiswhat/Managing-Mental-Health-adb0fb63a8144951b304bfb3bb7ed482), a Notion board where I collect resources around mental health and tech.
* [The React Native Community Map](https://www.notion.so/lifeiswhat/The-React-Native-Community-Map-07f3221c294d4c8ab65a13cf1dee6901), a Notion board for mapping where the RN community is.
* [rn-full-pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kelset.rn-full-pack#overview), an opinionated set of extensions to be up-and-running with React Native in VSCode.
